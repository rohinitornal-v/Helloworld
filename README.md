📘 Git & GitHub Learning Log

This document tracks my learning journey step by step as I learn Git and GitHub hands-on.

⸻

Day 1 — Getting Started with Git & GitHub

What I did
	•	Created a GitHub account
	•	Verified Git installation on macOS
	•	Configured Git with my username and email
	•	Learned the difference between Git (local) and GitHub (remote)
	•	Created a GitHub repository
	•	Initialized Git in a local project using git init
	•	Connected local repository to GitHub using git remote add origin
	•	Made my first commit
	•	Pushed code to GitHub

Challenges I faced
	•	Push was rejected because the remote repository already had a commit
	•	Encountered divergent branches and unrelated histories
	•	Git opened Vim during merge and I didn’t know how to exit initially

What I learned
	•	How Git tracks changes locally
	•	Why pulling before pushing is important
	•	How to safely resolve merge conflicts
	•	How to complete merge commits
	•	How Git error messages guide you to the solution

Day 2 — Building Confidence & Best Practices

What I did
	•	Checked repository status using git status
	•	Pulled latest changes using git pull
	•	Made small, intentional changes to the project
	•	Practiced the full workflow: edit → add → commit → push
	•	Cleaned up the repository by ignoring IDE files
	•	Removed tracked .idea/ files from Git history
	•	Pushed cleanup commits to GitHub

Best practices I learned
	•	Do not commit IDE-specific files (e.g., .idea/)
	•	Always use .gitignore
	•	Commit small, meaningful changes
	•	Read Git messages calmly instead of panicking
	•	Keep the repository clean and professional

Commands I’m now comfortable with

git status
git init
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git pull
git push
git remote add origin <url>

Reflection

In two days, I moved from being completely new to GitHub to confidently using Git commands, fixing real errors, and maintaining a clean repository. I now understand the basic workflow used by developers in real projects.

Next Goals
	•	Learn branching and pull requests
	•	Practice working on features in separate branches
	•	Connect GitHub projects to Azure
	•	Build and maintain multiple repositories
